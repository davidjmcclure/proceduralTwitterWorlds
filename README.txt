Takes a twitter query and constructs a (currently rather abstract) worldmap around it.

You'll need to put the various twitter API keys into their places in the "twitterMiner/miner.py" file.

Once you've done this the rest of the stuff should all be in "voronoiMain.py". Including the query you want to use and some other stuff that you probably won't need to change.

To run you'll want to run voronoiMain through the console in the usual way for Python files. 

Dependencies:

Python 2.7
NLTK
PyGame (although this can be removed without harming the actual XML output, it's more for a sample of the map)
